WSLHD is characterised by rapid population growth, cultural diversity, and wide socioeconomic variation. WSLHD population growth rate (10.3%) [3] was nearly double that of NSW (5.4%) [3] between 2020 and 2024.

I applied a consistent naming convention for all raw datasets, using the structure “variable_raw_year”. For example, the age dataset was named age_group_raw_2021. After cleaning, the naming convention remained the same except that “raw” was replaced with “nsw”, with the year indicating either 2021 or 2011.\nI then developed a cleaning script to clean and standardise the variables. The script applies a consistent cleaning workflow across all raw datasets, where only the variable name needs to be modified when processing a different variable dataset. For example, renaming age_group to cob (country of birth) in the cleaning script. The script performs the following key steps:\n\nRemoved descriptive lines at the head and tail of each CSV file that contain notes, retaining only the header and data rows.\nDeleted the Total column and any aggregated summary rows to avoid double-counting during rate calculations.\nRenamed the first column as sa2.\nSaved the cleaned datasets under the naming convention.\n\nNote: For the country of birth and language used at home, two datasets with varying levels of detail were utilised. The rationale for this decision is discussed in the Cultural Diversity section.\nThese cleaning steps ensure that all raw datasets are cleaned into a consistent structure, with redundancies removed, thereby preparing the data for reliable merging and downstream analysis. Figure 4 shows an example of a raw data file downloaded from TableBuilder and the corresponding cleaned dataset following the steps described above.\nFigure 4. Example of a variable dataset before and after cleaning. \nThe cleaning process of the IRSD dataset followed these steps. This dataset was prepared for socioeconomics and health analysis (see section: Socioeconomics and Health Profiles).\n\nExtracted the raw IRSD data from the SEIFA dataset (Table 2 within the SEIFA release) using Microsoft Excel 365.\nRemoved the descriptive lines at the head and tail of the table in Excel and saved the cleaned table as a raw CSV file.\nBecause some SA2 names in the raw IRSD dataset were incomplete, I developed a script to replace them using the authoritative sa2_name_2021 values obtained through the read_absmap() function from the strayr package.\nSaved the corrected dataset.\n\n\n\nGeography Mapping\nThis stage covered two tasks: mapping SA2s to LGAs and LHDs, and mapping 2021 SA2s and 2011 SA2s. Table 4 summarises all tasks in geography mapping.\nTable 4.

When SA2 overlaps occurred in different LGAs or LHDs, I assigned each SA2 to the LGA or LHD with the largest area of intersection to maintain a one-to-one relationship between SA2, LGA, and LHD, and I saved two datasets for both years. For example, the SA2 “Toongabbie – West” lies mostly within Blacktown, with a smaller portion extending into Cumberland. So, it was classified under Blacktown LGA. Similarly, the SA2 “Dural – Kenthurst – Wisemans Ferry” spans both WSLHD and NSLHD, but because most of its area falls within WSLHD, it was assigned to WSLHD.\nBut this classifying approach leaves some partially covered SA2s unassigned to their overlapping LGAs or LHDs. For example, the SA2 “Eastwood” lies mostly within NSLHD, with only a smaller portion lying within WSLHD. To ensure that WSLHD fully captured all SA2s within its geographic extent, I applied an additional manual step using reference mapping lists. Specifically, SA2s that intersect WSLHD but were not assigned to WSLHD under the largest area rule were manually appended to the WSLHD mapping. This process resulted in two WSLHD-specific mapping datasets for both years, which were used in subsequent WSLHD-focused analyses to ensure that all SA2s within the WSLHD geographic coverage were included.\n\n\nMapping 2021 and 2011 SA2 Correspondences\nThe SA2 boundaries changed between 2011 and 2021. For example, the 2016 SA2 “Riverstone - Marsden Park” was split into four smaller SA2s in 2021. They are called “Riverstone”, “Marsden Park – Shanes Park”, “Schofields (West) – Colebee” and “Schofields – East” [18]. To ensure comparability of population data across time, I need to establish a consistent correspondence between the different SA2 versions.\nABS provides correspondence files only for the 2011-2016 and 2016-2021 SA2 boundaries. Two correspondence files include ratios to describe how much one SA2 overlaps with another. I developed a script to link the 2011-2016 and 2016-2021 correspondence tables to derive a chained relationship between 2011 SA2 and 2021 SA2. The mapping process followed the following steps (check calculation):\nComputed chained weight along each 2011-2016-2021 path:\n\nw_{11,21} = w_{11,16} \\times w_{16,21}\n\nwhere w_{11,16} is the 2011–2016 correspondence ratio and w_{16,21} is the 2016–2021 correspondence ratio.\n\n\nShow code\n# Compute chained weight along each 2011→2016→2021 path\nmutate(w_11_21 = w_11_16 * w_16_21)\n\n\nAggregated to 2011–2021 pairs: If a 2011–2021 pair was connected through multiple 2016 SA2s, their intermediate weights were summed to produce a single weight_raw value for that pair:\n\n\\mathrm{weight}_{\\text{raw}}(i, j) = \\sum w_{11,21}(i, j)\n\nwhere i represents a 2011 SA2 and j represents a 2021 SA2.\n\n\nShow code\n# Aggregate weights for each unique 2011–2021 SA2 pair\ngroup_by(sa2_code_2011, sa2_name_2011, sa2_code_2021, sa2_name_2021) %&gt;%\nsummarise(weight_raw = sum(w_11_21, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n\nFor each 2021 SA2 (j), the raw weights from all contributing 2011 SA2s (i) were normalised so that their total equals 1. I created a new variable, weight_2021, to represent these normalised weights:\n\n\\mathrm{weight}_{2021}(i, j)\n=\n\\frac{\\mathrm{weight}_{\\text{raw}}(i, j)}\n{\\sum \\mathrm{weight}_{\\text{raw}}(i, j')}\n\nThis equation represents how much of each 2021 SA2 came from each 2011 SA2.\n\n\nShow code\n# For each 2021 SA2, weights from all 2011 SA2s sum to 1\n# p(2011 | 2021): contribution of 2011 SA2s to each 2021 SA2\ngroup_by(sa2_code_2021, sa2_name_2021) %&gt;%\nmutate(weight_2021 = weight_raw / sum(weight_raw, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\nungroup() \n\n\nFor each 2011 SA2 (i), the raw weights from all contributing 2021 SA2s (j) were normalised so that their total equals 1. I created a new variable, weight_2011, to represent these normalised weights:\n\n\\mathrm{weight}_{2011}(i, j)\n=\n\\frac{\\mathrm{weight}_{\\text{raw}}(i, j)}\n{\\sum \\mathrm{weight}_{\\text{raw}}(i', j)}\n\nThis equation represents how each 2011 SA2 was split across the 2021 SA2s.\n\n\nShow code\n# For each 2011 SA2, weights to all 2021 SA2s sum to 1\n# p(2021 | 2011): how each 2011 SA2 is split across 2021 SA2s\ngroup_by(sa2_code_2011, sa2_name_2011) %&gt;%\nmutate(weight_2011 = weight_raw / sum(weight_raw, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\nungroup()\n\n\nMoreover, I integrated the 2021 LGA and LHD mapping into the 2 SA2 correspondence types. This integration enabled the correspondence tables to link both across time (2011–2021) and across geographies (SA2 - LGA - LHD). I then saved two datasets (2021 view and 2011 view).\nTable 5 and Table 6 show examples of the 2011–2021 SA2 correspondence table from both perspectives. For instance, from the 2021 view, the 2021 SA2 “Box Hill – Nelson” was formed from two 2011 SA2s: 95% from “Rouse Hill - Beaumont Hills” and 44% from “Pitt Town - McGraths Hill”.\nTable 5.

The total column is not a manual sum of age groups. It is the default total provided by the Census dataset, which I assume reflects the population count for each SA2. This step established a baseline denominator for calculating proportions of variables.\n\n\nGeographic Classification\nI created two new binary variables, in_wslhd and in_metro (1 = yes, 0 = no), using the SA2–LGA–LHD mapping table to indicate whether each SA2 was located within WSLHD or within the metropolitan LHDs.\nI then selected key variables (sa2_name_2021 or sa2_name_2011, in_wslhd, in_metro, and pop_size) and saved them as two summary datasets. These datasets provide the foundation for analysing population change and for integrating variables in later steps."

I identified Non-residential SA2s by examining the lowest-population SA2s: the lowest 20 SA2s all had populations below 100, so they are identified as non-residential SA2s.\n\n\n\nShow code\n# Arrange SA2s by population size in ascending order (smallest first)\ncheck_pop_size &lt;- cencus_nsw_2021 %&gt;%\n  arrange(pop_size)\n\n# Display the first 30 SA2s (lowest populations)\nhead(check_pop_size, 30)\n\n# Extract non-residential from check_pop_size\nnon_res_sa2 &lt;- check_pop_size %&gt;%\n  arrange(pop_size) %&gt;%\n  \n  #

Population size in metropolitan LHDs and WSLHD, 2021 Census. \nFigure 6 shows that in terms of age composition, young adults (20–39) represent the largest group, followed by children and teens (0–19). This suggests potential for a deeper analysis of overall population growth and age-specific growth trends.\nFigure 6. Age-Group population distribution in WSLHD, 2021 Census. \nFigure 7 shows that in southern WSLHD, the proportions of overseas-born and non-English language used at home appear to be roughly half. This finding suggests two directions for further exploration: how these patterns vary spatially, and which specific countries of birth and languages contribute to this cultural diversity.\nFigure 7. Distribution of country of birth and language used at home in WSLHD, 2021 Census. \nFigure 8 demonstrates that WSLHD shows distinct patterns of socioeconomic distribution. Central areas show distinct socioeconomic advantages characterised by higher educational attainment, higher professional and managerial occupations, higher incomes, and lower social housing. Northern areas show relatively stable profiles, while southern areas display extensive socioeconomic disadvantages. The observed patterns require a deeper examination of socioeconomics within WSLHD.\nFigure 8. Distribution of education and occupation in WSLHD, 2021 Census. \nFigure 9 shows that Arthritis, asthma, diabetes, and mental health conditions emerged as the most prevalent long-term illnesses across WSLHD, reflecting the key areas of chronic disease burden within these regions.\nFigure 9.

These three topics also shape the main body of the scrollytelling article.\n\nPopulation Growth (2011–2021)\nAccording to the population size and age group choropleths, WSLHD had one of the largest populations in 2021, with a large proportion of young people. In this section, I compared population changes across the 6 metropolitan LHDs and 4 LGAs within WSLHD. I further examined age-group population changes within WSLHD over the same period. Table 11 summarises tasks in calculating population growth.\nTable 11.

I developed a script to calculate the contribution of each 2011 SA2 to each 2021 SA2 (check calculation):\n\n\\mathrm{pop}_{2011 \\rightarrow 2021}\n=\n\\sum\n\\left(\n\\mathrm{pop}_{2011}\\times \\mathrm{weight}_{2011}\n\\right)\n\nWhere \\mathrm{pop}_{2011} represents the pop_size variable extracted from the 2011 population file. \\mathrm{weight}_{2011} represents the weight_2011 variable extracted from the 2011-2021 SA2 correspondence file.\n\n\nShow code\n# --- Build pair-level table: 2011 → 2021 with authoritative 2021 names ---\npairs_11to21 &lt;- nsw_sa2_mapping_fix %&gt;%\n  left_join(pop_nsw_2011 %&gt;% select(key_2011, pop_2011), by = \"key_2011\") %&gt;%\n  left_join(\n    pop_nsw_2021 %&gt;% select(key_2021, sa2_name_2021, pop_2021),\n    by = \"key_2021\",\n    suffix = c(\"_map\", \"\")      # keep authoritative column names from right table\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    pop_2011 = coalesce(pop_2011, 0),\n    pop_2021 = coalesce(pop_2021, 0),\n    contrib_2011_to_2021 = pop_2011 * weight_2011\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(\n    sa2_name_2011, pop_2011,\n    sa2_name_2021, pop_2021,   # authoritative 2021 names\n    weight_2011, contrib_2011_to_2021\n  )\n\n# --- Aggregate 2011 → 2021 equivalent population using authoritative 2021 names ---\npop11_as_21 &lt;- pairs_11to21 %&gt;%\n  group_by(sa2_name_2021) %&gt;%\n  summarise(pop2011_as21 = sum(contrib_2011_to_2021, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n\nI created a pop2011_as21 variable that represents \\mathrm{pop}_{2011 \\rightarrow 2021}. Moreover, I then combined this with geographic classifications and produced a new dataset for analysing population growth patterns.\n\n\nExplore Population Growth from Metropolitan to WSLHD\nI developed a script based on this new population growth dataset to explore population growth patterns from the metropolitan LHDs down to WSLHD.\nI first plotted the 2011 and 2021 populations and growth rates of the 6 metropolitan LHDs. Figure 10 shows that WSLHD had the second largest population (1.04 million) in 2021 across Metropolitan LHDs but recorded the highest growth rate (29.7%).\nFigure 10. Population by Sydney metropolitan LHDs, 2011 and 2021 Census. \nNext, I highlighted those with population growth rates exceeding 100%, creating a clear visual contrast with the regular-growth SA2s. Figure 11 shows that SA2s with growth rates exceeding 100% were most concentrated in WSLHD, both in number and spatial clustering. These findings provide a strong entry point for my scrolltelling article: WSLHD is the metropolitan LHD with the most significant population growth, and a compelling region for deeper exploration of its internal patterns.\nFigure 11. Regular SA2s vs high-growth SA2s distribution across Sydney metropolitan LHDs. \nI then plotted the 2011 and 2021 populations for the four LGAs within WSLHD, along with their respective growth rates. Figure 12 shows that all four LGAs showed substantial population increases over the decade, which motivated Step 3 of examining how growth differs across age groups.\nFigure 12. Population by LGAs within WSLHD, 2011 and 2021 Census. \n\n\nCalculate Population Growth by Age Group\nUsing the cleaned age-group datasets for 2011 and 2021, I developed a script that applies the same population-growth method as before to compute SA2-level growth by age group. I also added indicators to identify whether each SA2 belonged to the metropolitan LHDs or specifically to WSLHD.\nI saved the resulting dataset containing SA2-level population counts and growth rates for each age group.\n\n\nExplore Population Growth by Age Group within WSLHD\nUsing the saved dataset from the last step, I developed a script to explore age group population growth by LGAs within WSLHD. Figure 13 shows that across all four LGAs, the younger population increased substantially between 2011 and 2021. At the same time, all LGAs experienced rapid growth in the 60+ age group, reflecting a clear ageing trend alongside overall expansion.\nFigure 13. Age group population by LGAs within WSLHD, 2011 and 2021 Census. \n\n\n\nCultural Diversity\nBased on the findings from Stage 1 of EDA, which highlighted substantial cultural diversity within WSLHD, I conducted a more detailed analysis. Table 12 summarises tasks in cultural diversity exploration.\nTable 12.

The data cleaning procedures followed the same approach used in earlier steps on variable cleaning.\n\n\nExplore Cultural Diversity Patterns\nAfter integrating these detailed datasets, I developed a script to examine cultural diversity across the six metropolitan LHDs in 2021.\nI began by comparing each LHD’s proportions of residents born in Australia versus overseas, as well as the proportions of English-speaking and non-English-speaking residents. Figure 14 shows that WSLHD had the highest level of cultural diversity in 2021, with 47.0% of residents born overseas and 50.7% of residents speaking a non-English language at home.\nFigure 14. Distribution of country of birth and language used at home by Sydney metropolitan LHDs, 2021 Census. \nI then identified the top ten overseas countries of birth and the non-English languages used at home. Figure 15 shows that India emerged as the leading country of birth by a substantial margin, followed by China and the Philippines. For languages, Mandarin and Arabic were the most spoken non-English languages across WSLHD.\nFigure 15. Top 10 overseas countries of birth and non-English languages used at home in WSLHD, 2021 Census. \nNext, I highlighted the SA2s where the proportions of overseas-born residents and residents who speak non-English languages at home exceeded the WSLHD average, as shown in Figure 16. These two groups of SA2s displayed an almost identical spatial pattern, both clustering strongly in the southern WSLHD.\nFigure 16.

They are closely linked to daily life and are easy to interpret for audiences. Across the four socioeconomic conditions, WSLHD shows patterns broadly similar to the metropolitan average, with some minor differences, as shown in Figure 17 and Figure 18.\n\nEducation: Among people aged 15 and over, 34.3% hold a bachelor’s degree or higher. 53.9% have qualifications below the bachelor level, a proportion slightly 0.3% lower than the metropolitan average (54.2%).\nOccupation: Among employed people aged 15 and over, 41.6% of workers are employed in managerial or professional roles, compared with 56.3% in non-professional roles. Both indicators differ from the metropolitan distribution by roughly 3%.\nPersonal income: Among employed people aged 15 and over, 45.5% of workers earn less than the NSW median, about 2% higher than the metropolitan average (43.3%).\nHousing type: 4.7% of occupied private dwellings in WSLHD are social housing, a modest 0.6 percentage-point increase relative to the metropolitan average (4.1%).\n\nFigure 17. Distribution of socioeconomic characteristics in WSLHD, 2021 Census. \nFigure 18. Distribution of socioeconomic characteristics in Sydney Metropolitan LHDs, 2021 Census. \n\n\nExplore Health Condition Patterns\nI compared WSLHD with metropolitan LHDs across various health conditions, examining differences in prevalence patterns and identifying conditions where WSLHD performed better or worse relative to the broader metropolitan region. Figure 19 shows that asthma, arthritis, and mental health conditions had the highest prevalence across all metropolitan LHDs, each exceeding 6%. WSLHD also demonstrated notable rates, with all three conditions above 5%. In addition, the prevalence of diabetes in WSLHD (5.2%) was higher than the metropolitan average (4.5%), indicating a relatively greater burden of chronic disease in WSLHD.\nFigure 19. Selected health condition proportions: Sydney Metropolitan LHDs vs WSLHD, 2021 Census. \n\n\nExplore the Relationship Between Socioeconomic Disadvantage and Health Burden\nGiven the well-established links between socioeconomic disadvantage and chronic disease, I combined these two dimensions by analysing deprivation and health burden together to examine spatial patterns in WSLHD. I need two indicators to measure deprivation and health burden, respectively.\n\nCompute Deprivation Percentile\nIRSD is a widely used area-level index of relative disadvantage. Its percentile ranking is positively coded, meaning that higher percentile values indicate less disadvantage. So, I reversed the values by using “100 − IRSD percentile” so that higher values represent greater deprivation (higher values = worse). I refer to this reversed measure as the deprivation percentile, which is used as the deprivation indicator in the analysis.\n\n\nCompute Health Burden Percentile\nFor the health burden measure, I did not identify an existing standard index suitable for assessing health burden at the SA2 level. So, I constructed a health burden indicator using the prevalence of selected health conditions by SA2.\nBased on the earlier analysis, I included the four conditions with the highest prevalence in WSLHD. Because they have a similar prevalence level (around 5–6%), and they appear more than the other conditions by at least 2%. This balance ensures that no single condition dominates or contributes negligible values to the composite index. The four conditions represent the overall health burden, while ensuring each condition contributes evenly to the composite measure.\nMy approach for measuring health burden is as follows:\n\n\nShow code\ntop4_diseases &lt;- c(\"prop_arthritis\", \"prop_asthma\", \"prop_diabetes\", \"prop_mental_health\")\n\nheal_burden &lt;- sem_wslhd_2021 %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(all_of(top4_diseases), as.numeric)) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Standardise each disease variable (higher = worse)\n  mutate(across(all_of(top4_diseases), ~ as.numeric(scale(.x)), .names = \"{.col}_z\")) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Row-wise mean burden (higher = worse)\n  mutate(burden_zmean = rowMeans(across(ends_with(\"_z\")), na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Compute health burden index (high = worse)\n  mutate(\n    health_burden_0_100      = rescale(burden_zmean, to = c(0, 100)),  # high = better\n    health_burden_decile     = ntile(health_burden_0_100, 10),\n    health_burden_percentile = round(percent_rank(health_burden_0_100) * 100, 0)\n  )\n\n\nDue to each condition having a different average prevalence and variability, its raw proportions are not directly comparable. To combine the four conditions into a single composite indicator, I needed to place them on a comparable scale. I used z-scores to standardise these prevalences.\n\nz = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n\nWhere x is the observed prevalence in each SA2, \\mu is the mean prevalence across all SA2s, and \\sigma is the standard deviation.\nFor each condition, the z-score shows how far an SA2 is above or below the average: a higher-than-average prevalence gives a positive z-score, and a lower-than-average prevalence gives a negative one. By placing all conditions on the same standardised scale, z-scores allow them to be compared fairly despite differences in their original prevalence levels.\nI then averaged the four z-scores to create a composite burden index and rescaled it to a 0–100 scale to produce an interpretable measure. However, rescaling alone does not indicate how each SA2 compares with others. To capture the relative position of each SA2 within the full distribution, I applied the percent-rank method to transform the index into a percentile measure (health burden percentile), ranging from 0 (lowest burden) to 100 (highest burden).\n\n\nConstruct a Bivariate Analytical Framework\nBuilding on the previous steps, I used bi_class() with style = \"quantile\" and dim = 3 to classify the deprivation percentile and health-burden percentile into tertiles (≤33rd, 34th–66th, and ≥67th percentiles), producing nine (3×3) bivariate classes. This process generated a new categorical variable bi_class, which labels each SA2 according to its combined class (e.g. 1–1, 1–2, …, 3–3).\n\n\nShow code\nbi_class(x = deprivation_percentile, y = health_burden_percentile, style = \"quantile\", dim = 3)\n\n\nNext, I constructed a bivariate 3×3 colour based on bi_class, as shown in Figure 20 (bottom left). The horizontal axis represents the deprivation percentile (from low to high, indicating increasing disadvantage), and the vertical axis represents the health burden percentile (from low to high, indicating worsening health burden). Using this 3×3 colour matrix as a legend, I then created a map and a scatter plot to explore the relationship between socioeconomic disadvantages and health burden across WSLHD.\n\n\nShow code\n# WGS84 (EPSG:4326) for Leaflet\nbiv_df_wgs84 &lt;- st_transform(biv_sem_health, 4326)\nmap_lga_wslhd_2021_wgs84 &lt;- st_transform(map_lga_wslhd_2021, 4326)\n\ncolor_palette &lt;- c(\n  \"1-1\" = \"#d3d3d3\", # low x, low y\n  \"2-1\" = \"#ba8890\",\n  \"3-1\" = \"#9e3547\", # high x, low y\n  \"1-2\" = \"#8aa6c2\",\n  \"2-2\" = \"#7a6b84\", # medium x, medium y\n  \"3-2\" = \"#682a41\",\n  \"1-3\" = \"#4279b0\", # low x, high y\n  \"2-3\" = \"#3a4e78\",\n  \"3-3\" = \"#311e3b\" # high x, high y\n)\n\n\nFigure 20 shows that SA2s with both high disadvantage and high health burden were primarily concentrated in southern Blacktown, while SA2s with both low disadvantage and low health burden cluster in northern Blacktown and along the boundary shared with The Hills Shire.\nFigure 20. Socioeconomic disadvantage and health burden across SA2s in WSLHD. \nAs shown in Figure 21, the x-axis represents deprivation percentile, the y-axis represents health-burden percentile, and bubble size reflects population size. Figure 21 shows that the relationship between deprivation and health burden is not strictly linear. Some low-deprivation SA2s experienced moderate to high health burden, while some highly deprived SA2s showed relatively low burden. These patterns highlight the internal diversity within WSLHD and suggest that factors beyond socioeconomic disadvantage also influence health outcomes.\nFigure 21. Socioeconomic disadvantage and health burden across SA2s in WSLHD."

Panning is then used in combination with zooming. Once the view is zoomed in on a particular feature, panning allows the perspective to shift smoothly to another focal point. This creates a guided, exploratory visual experience that helps readers follow the storyline across multiple important locations.\nAs shown in Figure 22, I first presented a map of Sydney City. The view then zooms into the Sydney Opera House, using this familiar landmark to capture the reader’s attention. The map subsequently pulls back and shifts westward, guiding the reader toward the main character, Western Sydney. I then presented Sydney Olympic Park as a representative of Western Sydney, anchoring the narrative within the region where the subsequent story unfolds.\nFigure 22. Zooming in from the Sydney Opera House and panning into Western Sydney. \nAs shown in Figure 23, I first presented a 2×2 set of bar charts that show the distribution of four key socioeconomic factors in WSLHD. Different colours indicate each factor. As the scroll progresses, the view successively zooms and pans in on each factor, while the narrative text on the right explains its distribution within WSLHD. For each factor, a corresponding metropolitan average bar chart appeared in sync with the narrative, providing a broader comparative context for interpreting WSLHD’s socioeconomic characteristics.\nFigure 23.

Warm colours (e.g. yellow and orange) were used to highlight the primary indicator or the focal topic within each discussion section. Cool colours (e.g. blue and green) served as background or secondary tones, helping differentiate the other indicator while maintaining visual balance.\nAs shown in Figure 24, I used yellow and green in both the choropleth maps and accompanying narrative to distinguish high-growth SA2s and regular SA2s. I also applied the same colour scheme to the relevant text elements to maintain visual consistency and reinforce the association between the map and the narrative for the reader.\nFigure 24. Using colour to distinguish between regular SA2s and high-growth SA2s. \nWhen introducing the cultural diversity of WSLHD, the use of colour was particularly important because multiple related yet conceptually distinct variables were presented together. As shown in Figure 25, I used orange and blue to present country distribution and yellow and green to present language distribution. I applied the same colour scheme to the narrative text and section headings to maintain visual consistency. This approach clearly distinguishes the two variables while visually linking them within the broader cultural diversity narrative.\nFigure 25.

Next, the spotlight gradually tightens to focus on WSLHD, while WSLHD is filled with an orange colour to emphasise its boundary within the metropolitan region, as shown in Figure 26 (right). The orange fill reinforces WSLHD as the narrative centrepiece, ensuring it stands out clearly within the larger metropolitan context.\nThe spotlight effect appears through a CSS pseudo-element layered above the map image. The full-size ::after overlay applies a radial-gradient background, with the gradient centre, radius, and feathering controlled via CSS custom properties.

Click on an SA2 reveals a hover panel that shows the SA2, LGA, 2021 population, 2011 population, absolute population change, and growth rate.

Clicking a SA2 reveals a hover panel displaying its geographic information, proportions of selected health conditions, and its deprivation and health-burden percentile groups.\nFigure 32. Example of socioeconomic disadvantages and health burden interactive map. \nI also applied the same bivariate colour grid to produce an interactive scatter plot through the plotly package, as shown in Figure 33. This visualisation provides a clear and intuitive distribution-level perspective, allowing readers to see how SA2s are clustered across the combined socioeconomic–health spectrum.\nFigure 33. Example of socioeconomic disadvantages and health burden interactive scatter plot. \nI separated the interactive map and the scatter plot into two-tab panels to enhance the user experience.\nI also compiled all interactive figures into a separate dashboard page that users can access through the navigation bar at the top, as shown in Figure 34. The dashboard contains three-tab panels that organise the content into three sections aligned with the story. The design structure allows users to explore different content areas while maintaining the story page as a linear storytelling experience.\nFigure 34. Dashboard user interface."

The red elements represent the local Aboriginal community, strengthened by these values.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nWelcome to Sydney, Australia!\n\n\n\n\nThis is a city map.\n\n\n\n\nThe blue marker represents the iconic Sydney Opera House, an enduring symbol of Sydney that attracts visitors from all over the world.\n\n Image Source: Photograph by Zachary Xie\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Sydney Opera House, about 30 kilometres to the west, lies Western Sydney.\n\n\n\n\nWestern Sydney is a rapidly developing region.\n\n\n\n\nThe red marker represents Parramatta CBD, which is the vibrant heart of Western Sydney. \n\n\n\n\nJust nearby lies Sydney Olympic Park, home to the city’s largest stadium and the main venue of the 2000 Summer Olympics.\n\n Image Source: Sydney.com\n\n\n\n\nIn this document, I will use 2021 and 2011 Census data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to tell you a story about the demographic, socioeconomic, and health profiles of Western Sydney and its people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s begin with a brief introduction to Western Sydney.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a partial map of New South Wales.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s turn our attention to the areas outlined in purple. They represent the six Sydney Metropolitan Local Health Districts:\n\nNepean Blue Mountains\nNorthern Sydney\nSouth Eastern Sydney\nSouth Western Sydney\nSydney\nWestern Sydney\n\n\n\n\n\nThese six LHDs form the healthcare network of metropolitan Sydney, delivering health services across the region and covering over 60% of NSW’s total population.\n\n\n\n\nThe orange area represents WSLHD, which provides hospital, community, and specialist health services to people living across Western Sydney.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the population shifts in Sydney metropolitan from 2011 to 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census, around 4.14 million people lived in the metropolitan region, accounting for more than 60% of the entire NSW population.\n\n\n\n\nBy 2021, that metropolitan population had grown to 4.96 million, an additional 800,000 people in just ten years.\n\n\n\n\nWestern Sydney and South Western Sydney alone each passed the milestone of 1 million residents.\n\n\n\n\nWestern Sydney’s population growth rate alone has reached closely 30%. \n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s break down the metropolitan region in more detail.\n\n\n\n\nEach Local Health District can be mapped using Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) boundaries.\n\nDefined by the ABS, an SA2 represents a community where people live, work, and interact socially and economically.\n\n\nWhile SA2s do not always fit neatly within a single LHD, they provide a useful way to examine communities at a smaller geographic scale.\n\n\n\n\n\nI calculated SA2-level population growth rates to pinpoint the fastest-growing areas.\n\n\n\n\nI identified high-growth SA2s with growth rate exceeding 100%.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, we can find that most of high-growth SA2s are concentrated in Western Sydney. \n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s focus on the high-growth SA2s within Western Sydney. \n\n\n\n\nBack in 2011, the population of these eight SA2s were all under 10,000. Over just ten years, these communities grew at an extraordinary pace.\n\n\n\n\nThis rapid change reflects Western Sydney’s enormous growth and highlights the potential challenges faced by the LHD to deliver services to this rapidly growing and evolving population, with particular attention to sociodemographic patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s break down WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\nWSLHD is responsible for delivering public healthcare across 4 local government areas (LGAs):\n\n\nBlacktown\nThe Hills Shire\nParramatta\nCumberland\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Blacktown.\n\nBlacktown is the largest LGA in WSLHD by population, and the fastest-growing one as well.\nBetween 2011 and 2021, its population jumped from over 300,000 to more than 400,000, marking an impressive growth rate of over 30%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is The Hills Shire.\n\nThe Hills Shire is the largest LGA in WSLHD by land size, and the one that grew the fastest between 2011 and 2021, with its population soaring by 33%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Parramatta.\n\nParramatta is the CBD of Western Sydney and the second largest LGA in WSLHD by population.\nBetween 2011 and 2021, it rose from the third to the second most populous LGA in WSLHD, with its population surpassing 200,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Cumberland.\n\nThis area was formerly governed by Holroyd before being renamed in 2016, when the NSW Local Government amalgamations created the Cumberland Council in May.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2021, its population grew steadily, surpassing the 200,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s explore how the populations of the four LGAs have grown between 2011 and 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now integrate the population bar charts of the four LGAs for a comparative view.\n\n\n\n\nBut that’s not enough…\n\n\n\n\nIf we break the population down into four age groups, an interesting pattern begins to emerge.\n\n\n\n\nAcross all four LGAs, young adults grew by about 30%, reaching more than 350,000 people in total.\n\n\n\n\nWhat we see is a surge of young adults flowing into Western Sydney, becoming the driving force of the region’s population. This trend reflects WSLHD status as an economic hub.\n\n\n\n\nAlongside the growth of the young workforce, there has also been a significant increase in the number of children and teenagers.\n\n\n\n\nThis suggests that the young generation represents a dominant profile in Western Sydney.\n\n\n\n\nBut there’s another striking pattern…\n\n\n\n\nIn just ten years, the 60+ population grew by over 40% in total, the highest increase of all age groups.\n\n\n\n\nIn Blacktown and The Hills Shire, the growth rate even topped 50%, highlighting the significant healthcare challenges that an ageing population already presents for WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📈 Population Growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWSLHD is a vibrant and culturally diverse district, enriched by communities that speak different languages and represent cultures from around the world.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s now explore the cultural diversity within WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we examine the distribution of country of birth across the metropolitan LHDs.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, 47.0% of WSLHD’s population was born overseas, the highest proportion among all metropolitan LHDs.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it’s not just country of birth, language used at home matters too.\n\n\n\n\nThe languages used at home show a similar proportion.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, people who used non-English languages at home made up more than 50% of WSLHD. \n\n\n\n\nThis highlights Western Sydney as the most culturally diverse part of Sydney metropolitan.\n\n\n\n\nThis pattern also makes us more interested in the migrant structure of Western Sydney, so we continue to break down WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\nAcross WSLHD, Cumberland and Parramatta have a majority overseas-born population (~52–53%).\n\nBlacktown is roughly balanced (~50/50), while The Hills Shire is more Australian-born (~58%).\n\n\n\n\nHome-language patterns mirror this:\n\nIn Cumberland and Parramatta, the majority of residents do not speak English at home (55–65%).\n\nBlacktown is closer to an even split, while in The Hills Shire, most residents speak English at home (~59%).\n\n\n\n\nSo what we really want to know:\n\nWho are the main migrant communities in Western Sydney?\n\n\n\n\nHere, we integrate the top 10 overseas countries of birth and the top 10 non-English languages used at home to see how migration and language connect across WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\nIndia leads by a large margin, with China and the Philippines next.\n\nOther countries like South Korea, Nepal, Lebanon, and Sri Lanka add to the rich mix of communities across Western Sydney.\n\n\n\n\nMandarin, Arabic, Cantonese, and Hindi are leading the way.\n\nPunjabi, Korean, Tamil, and Tagalog are also commonly used at home.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, I identified the SA2s where both the overseas-born population and the share of non-English languages used at home are higher than WSLHD’s overall averages.\n\n\n\n\nThese hotspots are largely clustered in Cumberland and Parramatta. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🌍 Country of Birth\n🗣️ Language Used at Home\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn WSLHD, residents bring different educational backgrounds, work in diverse occupations, earn across a wide range of incomes, and live in many types of housing, which forms a dynamic and vibrant community.\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s explore the socioeconomic patterns within WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we focus on four factors that are closely connected to everyday life, including:\n\n\nEducation,\nOccupation,\nPersonal Income,\nHousing Type\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong people aged 15 and over, the level of highest educational attainment shows that 34.3% had a bachelor’s degree or higher, while 53.9% hold qualifications below the bachelor level.\n\nThe pattern was broadly similar to the metropolitan average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong employed persons aged 15 years and over, 41.6% were managers or professionals, while 56.3%worked in non-professional roles.\n\nCompared with the metropolitan average, the share of managerial and professional occupations was 3.5% lower, while the share of non-professional roles was 3.3% higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal income was classified using the 2021 NSW median weekly personal income of $813 as the baseline.\n\nNote: Income data can only be obtained in ranges rather than exact amounts, so minor boundary effects exist.\n\n\n\n\nAmong people aged 15 and over, about 45.5% of residents earned less than the NSW median, representing more than 400,000 people.\n\nIn contrast, those earning at or above the median accounted for around 425,000 (47.8%) residents.\n\n\n\n\nCompared with the metropolitan average, the share of low-income earners in WSLHD was around 2.2% higher, while the share of middle-high-income earners was about 2.4% lower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 4.7% of occupied dwellings in WSLHD was social housing, slightly above the metropolitan average of 4.1%.\n\n\n\nNote: Social housing refers to dwellings provided by the government or community to people in need.\n\n\n\n\nSpatially, social housing was concentrated in southern WSLHD, where proportions exceed the WSLHD average of 4.7%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocioeconomic conditions are closely related to health outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nNext, we turn to see how socioeconomic conditions and health outcomes interact to shape life in WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s look at the healthcare network in WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\nThe acute care facilities within WSLHD include Blacktown Hospital, Mount Druitt Hospital, Westmead Hospital, Auburn Hospital\n\nIn addition, Cumberland Hospital serves as a specialised mental health facility.\n\n\n\n\nThis is Blacktown Hospital. \n\n\n\n\nThis is Mount Druitt Hospital. \n\n\n\n\nThese are Westmead Hospital and Cumberland Hospital. \n\n\n\n\nThis is Auburn Hospital. \n\n\n\n\nThese hospitals, along with their dedicated healthcare workers, stand at the frontline of care, protecting the health of over a million people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 2021 Census, ten selected health conditions were surveyed, including:\n\n\nAsthma\nArthritis\nMental Health\nDiabetes\nHeart Disease\nCancer\nLung Condtions\nkidney Disease\nDementia\nStroke\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s compare WSLHD with the metropolitan LHD average across these health condition proportions.\n\n\n\n\nWe can find that asthma, arthritis, and mental health conditions had the highest prevalence among metropolitan LHDs, each exceeding 6%.\n\n\n\n\nThe health burden in WSLHD is also concerning, with these three conditions exceeding 5%.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the prevalence of diabetes in WSLHD (5.2%) is notably higher than the metropolitan (4.5%).\n\n\n\n\nWhen we focus on WSLHD, we can find that:\n\nAsthma, arthritis, mental health, and diabetes stand out with the highest prevalence, each showing a similar level of around 5–6% and exceeding the remaining conditions by at least 2%.\n\nThey provide a clear representation of WSLHD’s overall health burden.\n\n\n\n\nWith this foundation, we now examine how socioeconomic disadvantage intersects with these four conditions in WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI combined two measures:\n\n\nDeprivation Percentile: Computed from Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage (IRSD) from ABS (check calculation).\n\n\n\nHealth-burden Percentile: Computed from the proportions of four key health conditions (check calculation).\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing these two measures, I created the map shown here, which highlights how these patterns vary across SA2s in 2021.\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution reveals clear geographic patterns.\n\n\n\n\nSA2s with low deprivation and low health burden clustered along the Blacktown–The Hills Shire border\n\n\n\n\nSouthern Blacktown contained the highest concentrations of both deprivation and health burden.\n\n\n\n\nWhen we shift from the map view to a relationship view, we can find that the relationship between deprivation and health burden is not perfectly linear.\n\n\n\n\nSome SA2s with low deprivation still experienced moderate to high health burden.\n\n\n\n\nSome highly deprived SA2s demonstrated relatively low health burden.\n\n\n\n\nThese patterns reflect the internal diversity within WSLHD and suggest that local factors beyond socioeconomic disadvantage also influenced health outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nThey also tell us WSLHD contains more complex and interesting patterns waiting to be explored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📍 Map View\n📊 Distribution View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key takeaways from Western

projected to grow by nearly 30% over the decade to 2031, whereas healthcare workforce growth has been considerably slower, at less than half the rate of population growth.\n\n\n\n\nWSLHD stands at an important crossroads. Through continued effort and innovation, WSLHD can rise to meet the needs of a rapidly growing and increasingly diverse community, shaping a healthier future as it moves into the next decade.\n \n\n\nThe estimated populations for 2021 and 2031 are derived from NSW Health.\n\n\nThe 2021 healthcare workforce estimate is sourced from the NSW Health Workforce Data Report (2024).\n\n\nThe 2031 healthcare workforce estimate is a simple linear extrapolation based on 2019–2024 growth trends from the Workforce Data Report.
