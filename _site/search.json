They represent the 6 NSW Metropolitan Local Health Districts:\n\nNepean Blue Mountains\nNorthern Sydney\nSouth Eastern Sydney\nSouth Western Sydney\nSydney\nWestern Sydney\n\n\n\n\n\nThese 6 LHDs form the healthcare network of metropolitan NSW, providing health services to the people living in this region.\n\n\n\n\nThe orange area represents WSLHD, recognised as a leader in clinical care, research, and education across Western Sydney.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the population shifts in metropolitan NSW from 2011 to 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to 2011 Census, around 4.14 million people lived in the metropolitan region, accounting for about 60% of the entire NSW population.\n\n\n\n\nBy 2021, that metropolitan population had grown to almost 5 million, accounting for more than 60% of the entire NSW population.\n\n\n\n\nWestern Sydney and South Western Sydney alone each passed the milestone of 1 million residents.\n\n\n\n\nWestern Sydney’s population growth rate alone has reached closely 30%. \n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s break down the metropolitan region in more detail.\n\n\n\n\nEach Local Health District can be mapped using Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) boundaries.\n\nDefined by the ABS, an SA2 represents a community where people live, work, and interact socially and economically.\n\n\nWhile SA2s do not always fit neatly within a single LHD, together they provide a useful way to examine communities at a smaller geographic scale.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe calculated population growth rates by SA2. From this, we discovered that…\n\n\n\n\nWe identified high-grwoth SA2s with growth rate exceeding 100%.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, we found that most of high-grwoth SA2s are concentrated in Western Sydney. \n\n\n\n\nNext, we focus on the high-grwoth SA2s within Western Sydney. \n\n\n\n\nBack in 2011, their populations were all under 10,000. Over just ten years, these communities grew at an extraordinary pace.\n\n\nThis rapid change signals that WSLHD is full of fascinating and valuable patterns for us to explore…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s break down WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\nWSLHD is responsible for delivering public healthcare across 4 local government areas (LGAs):\n\n\nBlacktown\nThe Hills Shire\nParramatta\nCumberland\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Blacktown.\n\nBlacktown is the largest LGA in WSLHD by population, and the fastest-growing one as well.\nIn just a decade, its population jumped from over 300K to more than 400K, marking an impressive growth rate of over 30%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is The Hills Shire.\n\nThe Hills Shire is the largest LGA in WSLHD by land size, and the one that grew the fastest between 2011 and 2021, with its population soaring by 33%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Parramatta.\n\nParramatta is the CBD of Western Sydney and the second largest LGA in WSLHD by population.\nBetween 2011 and 2021, it rose from the third to the second most populous LGA in WSLHD, with its population surpassing 200K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Cumberland.\n\nCumberland was formerly known as Holroyd before being renamed in 2016. Between 2011 and 2021, its population grew steadily, surpassing the 200k mark by 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlet’s explore how the populations of the four LGAs have grown between 2011 and 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now integrate the population bar charts of the four LGAs for a comparative view.\n\n\n\n\nBut that’s not enough…\n\n\n\n\nIf we break the population down into four age groups:\n\n\nChildren & Teens (0–19)\nYoung Adults (20–39)\nMiddle-aged Adults (40–59)\nElderly People (60+)\n\n\n\n\n\nAn interesting pattern begins to emerge…\n\n\n\n\nWhat we see is a surge of young adults flowing into Western Sydney, becoming the driving force of the region’s population.\n\nAcross all four LGAs, young adults grew by about 30%, reaching more than 350K people in total.\n\n\n\n\nAlongside the growth of the young workforce, there has also been a significant increase in the number of children and teenagers, reflecting higher birth rates.\n\nThis suggests that young families represent the dominant household profile in Western Sydney.\n\n\n\n\nBut there’s another striking pattern…\n\n\n\n\nIn just ten years, the 60+ population grew by over 40% in total, the highest increase of all age groups.\n\nIn Blacktown and The Hills Shire, the growth rate even topped 50%, a clear sign of the aging people healthcare challenges already confronting WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve seen a surge of young workers flowing into Western Sydney. We believe this is strongly connected to the arrival of new migrants.\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s dive deeper into the cultural diversity.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we look at the country of birth distribution by metropolitan LHDs.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, 47.0% of WSLHD’s population was born overseas, the highest proportion among all metropolitan LHDs.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, not only the country of birth.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, the languages speaking at home show a similar proportion.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, non-English native speakers made up more than 50% of WSLHD. \n\n\n\n\nThe figures highlight Western Sydney as the most culturally diverse part of NSW metropolitan.\n\n\n\n\nThis pattern also makes us more interested in the migrant structure of Western Sydney, so we continue to break down WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\nAcross WSLHD, Cumberland and Parramatta have a majority overseas-born population (~52–53%).\n\nBlacktown is roughly balanced (~50/50), while The Hills Shire is more Australian-born (~58%).\n\n\n\n\nHome-language patterns mirror this:\n\nCumberland and Parramatta have a majority of Non-English (55–65%)., near parity in Blacktown, and The Hills Shire is English-dominant (~59%).\n\n\n\n\nSo what we really want to know:\n\nWho are the main migrant communities in Western Sydney?\n\n\n\n\nHere, we intergrate the top 10 overseas countries of birth and the top 10 non-English languages speaking at home to see how migration and language connect across WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\nIndia leads by a large margin, with China and the Philippines next. \n\n\n\n\nOther countries like South Korea, Nepal, Lebanon, and Sri Lanka add to the rich mix of communities across Western Sydney. \n\n\n\n\nMandarin, Arabic, Cantonese, and Hindi are leading the way. \n\n\n\n\nPunjabi, Korean, Tamil, and Tagalog are also commonly speaking at home. \n\n\n\n\nAlso, we identified the SA2s where both the overseas-born population and the share of non-English languages speaking at home are higher than WSLHD’s overall averages.\n\n\n\n\nThese hotspots are largely clustered in Cumberland and Parramatta. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s look at the healthcare network in WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\nThe acute care facilities within WSLHD include Blacktown Hospital, Mount Druitt Hospital, Westmead Hospital, Auburn Hospital\n\nIn addition, Cumberland Hospital serves as a specialised mental health facility.\n\n\n\n\nThis is Blacktown Hospital. \n\n\n\n\nThis is Mount Druitt Hospital. \n\n\n\n\nThey are Westmead Hospital and Cumberland Hospital \n\n\n\n\nThis is Auburn Hospital. \n\n\n\n\nThese hospitals, along with their dedicated healthcare workers, stand at the frontline of care, protecting the health of over a million people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we turn to see how socioeconomic factors and health outcomes interact to shape life in WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\nIn the 2021 Census, ten selected health conditions were surveyed.\n\n\n\n\nWe used these results to compare WSLHD with other metropolitan LHDs across conditions, including:\n\n\nAsthma\nArthritis\nMental Health\nDiabetes\nHeart Disease\nCancer\nLung Condtions\nkidney Disease\nDementia\nStroke\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found that asthma, arthritis, and mental health conditions had the highest prevalence across all metropolitan LHDs, each exceeding 6%.\n\n\n\n\nThe situation in WSLHD is also concerning, with all three conditions above 5%.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the prevalence of diabetes in WSLHD (5.2%) is notably higher than the metropolitan (4.5%).\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will analyse how these four conditions relate to socioeconomic factors within WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\nWe considered key socioeconomic factors:\n\n\nEducation level\nOccupation type\nUnemployment\nIncome\n\n\nTogether with the four most prevalent health conditions:\n\n\nArthritis\nAsthma\nMental health\nDiabetes\n\n\n\n\n\nBy plotting these two dimensions together, we can see how health and socioeconomic disadvantage intersect across WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\nThe SA2s showing both high socioeconomic disadvantage and heavy health burdens are clustered in southern Blacktown. \n\n\n\n\nThese high hotspots cluster in southern Blacktown. We also note a smaller set of SA2s in Cumberland showing medium health burden but high socioeconomic disadvantage—areas to watch as potential emerging risk zones.\n\n\n\n\nBeyond health factors alone, the pattern may also relate to the local living environment, so we next examine housing quality.\n\n\n\n\nIn the distribution of social housing proportions…\n\n\n\n\nwe can see that areas with a high share of social housing among occupied private dwellings are concentrated in southern Blacktown, while some SA2s with moderate proportions appear in Cumberland. \n\n\n\n\nWe suspect that the high concentration of social housing, where residents live under poor housing conditions, may also play a key role in shaping local health outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nTo explore this relationship, we next compare social housing with the health burden across WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\nWhen combining social housing proportions with the health burden index across WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\nwe can find a clear pattern:\n\nSA2s with a higher share of social housing tend to experience a higher health burden.\n\nMost of these areas fall within the high or very high socioeconomic disadvantage categories.\n\n\n\n\nThis pattern highlights the strong connection between housing disadvantage and health burden in WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\nNext, we highlight the SA2s that show high health burden and high socioeconomic disadvantage.\n\n\n\n\nOf the 12 SA2s, 11 cluster in southern Blacktown, and one lies in Cumberland.\n\n\n\n\nIn the 11 SA2s located in southern Blacktown, these areas make up 51.4% of Blacktown’s total population and 18.4% of the entire WSLHD.\n\n\n\n\nNext, we zoom in on southern Blacktown, where high disadvantage meets high health burden, to see how these areas perform across the four most common health conditions.\n\n\n\n\nAmong the 11 SA2s, nine show similar patterns, with the prevalence of the four conditions ranging between 5% and 8%.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Lethbridge Park – Tregear and Bidwill – Hebersham – Emerton, their rates for four conditions are above 7%, and asthma alone is nearing 11%. \n\n\n\n\nLet’s put these 11 SA2s back on the map and see where they cluster within Blacktown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out our graphic\n\n\n\n\nWe can keep referring to it as several triggers scroll by…\n\n\n\n\n… and have OJS code elsewhere in the document to animate it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key takeaways from Western Sydney’s journey between 2011 and 2021\n\n\n\n  \n     \n      \n         Population Growth\n\n        1.04M\n                         residents in 2021, +29.6% since 2011.\n        \n                         \n        32.6%\n                         of residents were young adults (20–39) in 2021.\n        \n        \n        43.3%\n                         growth of the 60+ population (2011–2021).\n        \n      \n\n      \n         Cultural Diversity\n        ~50%\n                         of residents were new immigrants in 2021.\n        \n                         \n        India and China (excluding SARs and Taiwan)\n                         were the top two overseas countries of birth.\n        \n        \n        Cumberland and Parramatta\n                         were LGAs with high concentrations of immigrants in 2021.\n        \n      \n\n      \n         Health Inequalities\n        \n        Asthma, Arthritis, Mental Health, and Diabetes\n                         were the top four health conditions with the highest prevalence.\n        \n        \n        51.4%\n                         of Blacktown’s population lives in the south, forming the core of health inequality hotspots.\n        \n                      \n        Lethbridge Park – Tregear and Bidwill – Hebersham – Emerton\n                         were the top two hardest-hit areas in 2021.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n\nThis document was created with Quarto and closeread.\n\n\nCreated by Zahcary Xie\n\n\nTechnical Paper | Repo"
