::: {focus-on="cr-metro-pop-4"}
Each [**Local Health District**]{style="color: #439755;"} can be mapped using Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) boundaries.

<br>

Defined by the ABS, an SA2 represents a community where people live, work, and interact socially and economically.

<br>

While SA2s do not always fit neatly within a single LHD, together they provide a useful way to examine communities at a smaller geographic scale. @cr-metro-pop-4

We calculated population growth rates by SA2. From this, we discovered that… @cr-metro-pop-4

We identified [**high-grwoth SA2s**]{style="color: #F59E0B;"} with growth rate exceeding 100%. @cr-metro-pop-5

Also, we found that most of [**high-grwoth SA2s**]{style="color: #F59E0B;"} are concentrated in Western Sydney.
[@cr-metro-pop-5]{scale-by="2.5" pan-to="-95%, -50%"}

Next, we focus  on the [**high-grwoth SA2s**]{style="color: #F59E0B;"} within Western Sydney.

Back in 2011, their populations were all under 10,000. Over just ten years, these communities grew at an extraordinary pace.

This rapid change signals that WSLHD is full of fascinating and valuable patterns for us to explore... @cr-metro-pop-6

WSLHD is responsible for delivering public healthcare across 4 [**local government areas (LGAs):**]{style="color: #F59E0B;"}

<br>

-   Blacktown
-   The Hills Shire
-   Parramatta

:::{focus-on="cr-wslhd-map-3"}

This is [**Blacktown.**]{style="color: #F59E0B;"} 

<br>

Blacktown is the largest LGA in WSLHD by population, and the fastest-growing one as well. 

In just a decade, its population jumped from over **300K** to more than **400K**, marking an impressive growth rate of over **30%**.

This is [**The Hills Shire.**]{style="color: #F59E0B;"} 

<br>

The Hills Shire is the largest LGA in WSLHD by land size, and the one that grew the fastest between 2011 and 2021, with its population soaring by **33%**.

This is [**Parramatta.**]{style="color: #F59E0B;"} 

<br>

Parramatta is the CBD of Western Sydney and the second largest LGA in WSLHD by population. 

Between 2011 and 2021, it rose from the third to the second most populous LGA in WSLHD, with its population surpassing **200K**.

This is [**Cumberland.**]{style="color: #F59E0B;"} 

<br>

Cumberland was formerly known as Holroyd before being renamed in 2016. Between 2011 and 2021, its population grew steadily, surpassing the **200k** mark by 2021.

<br>

![](images/cl_pop_1.png){style="width:100%; height:50%; object-fit:contain; border-radius:2px"}

let’s explore how the populations of the four LGAs have grown between 2011 and 2021. @cr-wslhd-map-1

We now integrate the population bar charts of the four LGAs for a comparative view. @cr-wslhd-pop-1

But that’s not enough... @cr-wslhd-pop-1

![](images/wslhd_pop_1.png){fig-align="left" style="width:100%; height:100%; border-radius:0"}
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-wslhd-pop-2"}

If we break the population down into four age groups:

<br>

-   Children & Teens (0–19)
-   Young Adults (20–39)
-   Middle-aged Adults (40–59)
-   Elderly People (60+)

:::

An interesting pattern begins to emerge… @cr-wslhd-pop-2

::: {#cr-wslhd-pop-2}
![](images/wslhd_pop_2.png){fig-align="left" style="width:100%; height:100%; border-radius:0"}
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-wslhd-pop-2-1"}

What we see is a surge of young adults flowing into Western Sydney, becoming the driving force of the region’s population.

<br>

Across all four LGAs, young adults grew by about **30%**, reaching more than **350K** people in total.

:::

::: {#cr-wslhd-pop-2-1 .viz}

:::


:::{focus-on="cr-wslhd-pop-2-2"}

Alongside the growth of the young workforce, there has also been a significant increase in the number of children and teenagers, reflecting higher birth rates.

<br>

This suggests that **young families** represent the dominant household profile in Western Sydney.

:::

::: {#cr-wslhd-pop-2-2 .viz}
![](images/wslhd_pop_2.png){fig-align="left" style="width:100%; height:100%; border-radius:0"}
:::

But there’s another striking pattern... @cr-wslhd-pop-2-3

:::{focus-on="cr-wslhd-pop-2-3"}

In just ten years, **the 60+ population grew by over 40% in total**, the highest increase of all age groups.

<br>

In Blacktown and The Hills Shire, the growth rate even topped 50%, a clear sign of the aging people healthcare challenges already confronting WSLHD.

:::

We’ve seen a surge of young workers flowing into Western Sydney. We believe this is strongly connected to the arrival of new migrants. @cr-wslhd-pop-2-3

Now, let’s dive deeper into the cultural diversity. @cr-wslhd-pop-2-3

::: {#cr-wslhd-pop-2-3 .viz}
![](images/wslhd_pop_2.png){fig-align="left" style="width:100%; height:100%; border-radius:0"}
:::

First, we look at the country of birth distribution by metropolitan LHDs. @cr-metro-cob-1

In 2021, [**47.0% of WSLHD’s population was born overseas**]{style="color: #D46C4E;"}, the highest proportion among all metropolitan LHDs. [@cr-metro-cob-1]{scale-by="2" pan-to="100%, -40%"}

However, not only the country of birth. @cr-metro-cob-1

::: {#cr-metro-cob-1}
![](images/metro_cob_1.png){fig-align="left" style="width:100%; height:100%; border-radius:0"}
:::

Also, the languages speaking at home show a similar proportion. @cr-metro-cd-1

In 2021, [**non-English native speakers made up more than 50% of WSLHD**]{style="color: #F59E0B;"}.
[@cr-metro-cd-1]{scale-by="2" pan-to="100%, -40%"}

The figures highlight Western Sydney as the most culturally diverse part of NSW metropolitan. @cr-metro-cd-1

This pattern also makes us more interested in the migrant structure of Western Sydney, so we continue to break down WSLHD. @cr-metro-cd-1

::: {#cr-metro-cd-1}
![](images/metro_cd_1.png){fig-align="left" style="width:100%; height:100%; border-radius:0"}
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-wslhd-cd-1"}

Across WSLHD, **Cumberland** and **Parramatta** have a majority [**overseas-born population (~52–53%)**]{style="color: #D46C4E;"}. 

<br>

**Blacktown** is roughly balanced **(~50/50)**, while **The Hills Shire** is more [**Australian-born (~58%)**]{style="color: #43978D;"}.

:::

:::{focus-on="cr-wslhd-cd-1"}

Home-language patterns mirror this: 

<br>

**Cumberland** and **Parramatta** have a majority of [**Non-English (55–65%)**]{style="color: #F59E0B;"}., near parity in Blacktown, and **The Hills Shire** is [**English-dominant (~59%)**]{style="color: #439755;"}.

:::

:::{focus-on="cr-wslhd-cd-1"}

So what we really want to know: 

<br>

**Who are the main migrant communities in Western Sydney?**

:::

::: {#cr-wslhd-cd-1}
![](images/wslhd_cd_1.png){fig-align="left" style="width:100%; height:100%; border-radius:0"}

Here, we intergrate the **top 10** [**overseas**]{style="color: #D46C4E;"} countries of birth and the **top 10** [**non-English**]{style="color: #F59E0B;"} languages speaking at home to see how migration and language connect across WSLHD. @cr-wslhd-cd-2

**India** leads by a large margin, with **China** and the **Philippines** next. 
[@cr-wslhd-cd-2]{scale-by="3" pan-to="100%, 100%"}

Other countries like **South Korea**, **Nepal**, **Lebanon**, and **Sri Lanka** add to the rich mix of communities across Western Sydney. 
[@cr-wslhd-cd-2]{scale-by="3" pan-to="100%, 100%"}

**Mandarin**, **Arabic**, **Cantonese**, and **Hindi** are leading the way.
[@cr-wslhd-cd-2]{scale-by="3" pan-to="100%, -42%"}

**Punjabi**, **Korean**, **Tamil**, and **Tagalog** are also commonly speaking at home.

Also, we identified the SA2s where both the [**overseas-born**]{style="color: #D46C4E;"} population and the share of [**non-English**]{style="color: #F59E0B;"} languages speaking at home are higher than WSLHD’s overall averages. @cr-wslhd-cd-3

We used the Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage (IRSD) from the ABS to calculate deprivation percentile. 

<br>

We then combined it with the health burden percentile based on the four most common health conditions to compare socioeconomic disadvantage and health burden across WSLHD.

By integrating bivariate, we created an interactive map and scatter plot to help visualise and better understand how socioeconomic disadvantage and health burden intersect across different areas.

We can find that areas with low deprivation and low health burden cluster around the Blacktown–The Hills Shire border, while high health burden and high deprivation are concentrated in Southern Blacktown.
